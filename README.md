# build
A simple script that will download and build the emulatorjs core files

This script will download and build most of the available retroarch cores.

> **Warning**: Some cores do not compile on ARM based systems (such as M series MacBooks and Raspberry Pi). Use only amd64 based systems to compile.

# Set up your build environment

## VSCode and Dev Containers
This repo contains a devcontainer configuration.

Using docker and VSCode, the repo can be started in a container, where all dependencies are installed for you.

## Local
This guide assumes you're using a Debian or Ubuntu type system.

* Run ``sudo apt update && sudo apt install jq wget curl gpg p7zip-full binutils-mips-linux-gnu build-essential pkgconf python3 git zip libsdl2-dev``

* Run the enclosed ``build_env.sh`` script to configure the build environment. You may need to use sudo to run this script to install system components.

# Compiling
Execute the command ``source ./.emsdk/emsdk_env.sh && bash build.sh`` in the repo root to begin compiling.

Compilation will be performed in ``./compile``, and the completed assets will be copied to ``./output``, with logs in ``./output/logs``.

# Adding new cores
To add a new core, add a stanza like the below:
```json
{
    "name": "mame2003",
    "extensions": [ "zip" ],
    "makeoptions": {
        "buildpath": "./",
        "makescript": "Makefile",
        "arguments": []
    },
    "options": {
        "file": "MAME 2003 (0.78)/MAME 2003 (0.78).opt",
        "settings": {
            "mame2003_skip_disclaimer": "enabled",
            "mame2003_skip_warnings": "enabled"
        },
        "defaultWebGL2": false,
        "supportsMouse": false
    },
    "license": "LICENSE.md",
    "repo": "https://github.com/EmulatorJS/mame2003-libretro",
    "branch": "main"
}
```

| Attribute | Definition |
| --------- | ---------- |
| ``name``      | The name of the core. This value should be the name of the compiled core .data file. |
| ``extensions`` | An array of file extensions used by the core |
| ``license``   | The path to the repo project license file. This path is relative to the root of the repo. |
| ``repo``      | A link to the project repository |
| ``branch``    | The git branch to switch to when building |
| ``makeoptions`` | Settings and options for building the core (see makeoptions table below) |
| ``options``   | Options to be set by the emulator (see options table below) |
| ``status``    | ``0`` or not set = ``stable``<br />``1`` = ``beta``<br />``2`` = ``experimental``<br />``3`` = ``don't build`` - the build script will skip building the core |

### makeoptions
| Attribute | Definition |
| --------- | ---------- |
| ``buildpath`` | The path within the repo to the make script |
| ``makescript`` | The name of the make script |
| ``arguments`` | An array of command line options to pass to the make script |

### options
| Attribute | Definition |
| --------- | ---------- |
| ``file``      | The relative path and file name for the core options file |
| ``settings``  | A hash table of attributes and their values to write to the core options file |
